# Book Store
The Bookstore project is to display a list of books, add a book, and remove a selected book. I have used React.Js as frontend library. There are also different tools I have used like linters, GitHub flow, GitFlow and Jest for testing porpuse.

This project is build using React framework and I have used `stylelint` and `eslinte` for checking linter errors.
> Below features are added here
